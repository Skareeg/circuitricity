Yes, seriously, I'm learning from a Udemy course. Bite me.

Current = Change in Charge / Change in Time
I = dq / dt
1C (coulomb) of charge per second = 1A (ampere).
1C/s = 1A
0.1A could potentially kill a person. 1A is a lot.
Conventional current is the flow of positive "holes", opposite that of the electrons.
+5A conventional current = -5A in the opposite direction.

Rough current needs:
Single Gate in a uProcessor     10nA
Light Emitting Diode            20mA
Digital TTL Chip                30mA
Single Gate in TTL Chip         5mA
LCD Calculator                  50mA
27" Television                  2A
Personal Computer               5A
Hair Dryer                      10A

Most AC U.S. sockets support 120V 10A - 20A. Hair Dryer is about 1000W, maybe 1200W max.
