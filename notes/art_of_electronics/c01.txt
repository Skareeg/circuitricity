These are form the "Art of Electronics" from Paul Horowitz. This thing a weapon of a book.

Voltage can be "V" or "E" in symbology.
Voltage = cost in energy or work required to move a unit of positive charge from the negative charge or potential to the higher potential.
1J (joule) of work from 1C (coulomb) of charge over 1V (volt).

Current is "I". The unit of current is Amperage / Amps with symbol "A".
Current = rate of flow of charge at a certain point.
1A (amp) = 1C (coulomb) / s (second).

Voltage is always across two points. Current is always the flow through an object.
Voltage is commonly with one point in the circuit and another in the "ground", but can be between any two points.

Generate voltages by moving charges. Generate currents by placing voltage differences.

Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) = Sum of currents into a system is equal to the sum of the currents out. Conservation of energy.
Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) = Sum of the voltage differences of any pathway from A to B with things in parallel are the same votlage differences as the other pathways.
    The sum of the voltage differences in a completely closed circuit is zero.
P (power in watts) = V * I. P = 1J / s.
